# General Store Management System
A comprehensive General Store Management System built with Flutter. This project is designed for multiplatform use (Windows, Android, and Web) with a strong emphasis on an offline-first architecture.

Core features include sales registration, product/price lookups, and dispatch management. All operations can be performed offline and are automatically synchronized with a central cloud database when a connection is available, ensuring data integrity across all devices.
